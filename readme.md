#crud-o-matic

CURD generator targeting at frontend: angular es6 & bootstrap. backend: express & mongoose.

# Frontend

Angular ES6 / Bootstrap.

It requires many modules, including some I personaly use in my seed project:
[llafuente/angular-es6-stack](https://github.com/llafuente/angular-es6-stack)
It's better to bootstrap the angular side with it.

# Backend

Server side is self-contained in the generated files, but it requires the
generator to create mongoose schema/models. This will be solved soon
and server side will be 100% self-contained after generation.

# TODO

* pupolate query list
* add JS con list.controller.js based on filters
